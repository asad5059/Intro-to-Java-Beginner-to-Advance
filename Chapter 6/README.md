Chapter 6 of the book "Java The Complete Reference" covers the topic of "Classes and Objects". The chapter starts with a brief overview of classes and objects and their importance in Java programming. It then goes on to explain the various components of a class such as instance variables, constructors, and methods.
The chapter also covers the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in detail. It explains how inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, and how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class.

Polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance are three fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming and are key features of the Java programming language.

## Polymorphism:
Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class. It is achieved through inheritance and interfaces. Polymorphism allows for code to be written that can work with objects of different types, providing greater flexibility and reusability.
## Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for accessing and modifying the object's state. In Java, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers such as public, private, and protected, and by providing public methods for accessing and modifying object state. Encapsulation provides several benefits, including improved security and maintainability of code.

## Inheritance:
Inheritance is the process of creating new classes from existing classes. The new classes inherit properties and methods from the existing classes, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. In Java, inheritance is achieved through the use of the "extends" keyword, which allows a subclass to inherit from a superclass. Subclasses can then add or override methods and properties of the superclass.

```java
// Base class Vehicle
class Vehicle {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Vehicle(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle starting...");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopping...");
    }

    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }
}

// Derived class Car
class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numDoors;

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year, int numDoors) {
        super(brand, model, year);
        this.numDoors = numDoors;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting...");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopping...");
    }

    public int getNumDoors() {
        return numDoors;
    }
}

// Derived class Motorcycle
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    private int numWheels;

    public Motorcycle(String brand, String model, int year, int numWheels) {
        super(brand, model, year);
        this.numWheels = numWheels;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle starting...");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle stopping...");
    }

    public int getNumWheels() {
        return numWheels;
    }
}

// Main class
public class VehicleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an array of Vehicle objects
        Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[3];
        vehicles[0] = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022, 4);
        vehicles[1] = new Motorcycle("Honda", "CBR1000RR", 2022, 2);
        vehicles[2] = new Vehicle("Boat", "Sailboat", 2022);

        // Polymorphism in action
        for (Vehicle v : vehicles) {
            System.out.println(v.getBrand() + " " + v.getModel() + " (" + v.getYear() + ")");
            v.start();
            v.stop();
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
In this program, we have a base class Vehicle that contains properties such as brand, model, and year, as well as methods for starting and stopping the vehicle. We then have two derived classes, Car and Motorcycle, which inherit from the Vehicle class and add their own properties and methods.

The VehicleDemo class creates an array of Vehicle objects that includes one Car, one Motorcycle, and one Vehicle. The program then uses polymorphism to loop through each object in the array and call its start() and stop() methods, which will call the appropriate method for each object based on its type.

This program also demonstrates encapsulation, as the Vehicle class has private properties that can only be accessed through public methods such as getBrand(), getModel(), and getYear(). This helps to ensure that the internal state of the object remains consistent and secure.

Finally, this program shows inheritance in action, as the Car and Motorcycle classes inherit properties and methods from the Vehicle class. This allows us to write less code and reuse existing

In summary, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance are key concepts in Java programming and object-oriented programming in general. They provide important benefits such as code reuse, flexibility, and improved maintainability. By understanding these concepts, developers can write more efficient and effective Java code.

The chapter also covers the concepts of abstract classes and interfaces, which are used to define common behavior for classes that share a certain set of characteristics.

Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on access control and how it can be used to restrict access to class members.

Overall, Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive introduction to classes and objects in Java and the various concepts associated with them. It provides numerous code examples to illustrate these concepts and their practical applications.
