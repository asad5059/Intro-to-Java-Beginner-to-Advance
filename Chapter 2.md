### Java Abstraction:
Java abstraction is a key concept in OOP that enables developers to create simplified models of complex systems. Abstraction involves identifying the essential features of an object or system and ignoring or hiding the irrelevant details. In Java, abstraction is implemented using classes, interfaces, and abstract classes.
### Class:
Classes are the building blocks of Java programs and are used to define objects. A class can be thought of as a blueprint for an object, specifying the properties and methods that the object will have. Interfaces are similar to classes but only define method signatures without specifying their implementation. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated but can be extended by other classes.
### Three OOP features:
Encapsulation is another important concept in OOP that involves bundling data and methods into a single unit, called a class, and hiding the details of how the data is managed. Inheritance allows developers to create new classes that are derived from existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods. Polymorphism allows objects to take on different forms, depending on the context in which they are used.

By using OOP and Java abstraction, developers can create modular, reusable code that can be easily maintained and updated. By breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable parts, developers can work on individual components without affecting the overall system. Additionally, abstraction allows developers to work at a higher level of abstraction, reducing the complexity of the code and making it easier to understand and modify.


### A Simple JAVA Program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Let's break down what's happening in this program:

- The program begins with the public class HelloWorld statement, which defines the name of the class as HelloWorld.
- The **public** keyword means that the class can be accessed by code outside of its own package.
- Inside the class, we have a **public static void main(String[] args)** method, which is the entry point for the program.
- The **public** and **static** keywords indicate that the main method can be accessed from outside the class and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- The **void** keyword indicates that the main method does not return any value.
- The **String[] args** parameter is an array of command-line arguments that may be passed to the program when it is executed.
- Finally, inside the main method, we have a single line of code: **System.out.println("Hello, World!");** This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
- To run this program, save the code in a file called **HelloWorld.java**, then compile it using the command javac **HelloWorld.java**. This will create a file called **HelloWorld.class**. To run the program, type the command java HelloWorld in the terminal. You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed to the console.
